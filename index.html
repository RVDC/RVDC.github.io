<h3>Camp description:</h3>
<p>This camp offers a full-day outdoor experience in a secure, supervised setting for girls age 6 and up.

<p>All units are age-based and will participate in camp-planned activities and events as well as enjoy free time to socialize and build friendships. All units are adult volunteer-led with young adult assistants Campers may request one buddy from their age level. Attempts will be made to honor the request only if both campers request one another, and all registration forms and fees are received in one envelope and ages are same level. We cannot accommodate requests that do not follow this procedure. </p>
